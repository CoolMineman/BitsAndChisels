Bits and Chisels is a Fabric mod for modern Minecraft that lets you remove small bits from blocks using chisels. You can use these bits to build detailed decorations or whatever else you want. Requires Fabric API. Has Canvas Renderer support for shaders. Uses greedy meshing and the Fabric Renderer API to achieve high FPS post-1.13 rendering changes. This mod was inspired by Chisel and Bits.

## FAQ

### Will This Work With Optifine or Sodium?

Sodium requires the experimental Indium https://github.com/comp500/Indium
Download Instructions For Indium https://github.com/comp500/Indium/issues/13#issuecomment-766741351

**Optifine will not work and is not supported.**

### I Used /give And I'm Confused/Crashing/Whatever!

Use the creative tab please, using /give on bitsandchisels:bits_block or bitsandchisels:bit_item will likely cause issues.

### Did You Port C&B?

No, all the code is 100% original.

### Will This Lag My Game?

Lag should be minimal post 2.1.0 with the new greedy meshing.
